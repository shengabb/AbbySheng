      I'm a first-year Master of Environmental Studies student at UPenn and a recent BSc. graduate in Economics from LSE. Growing up in both China and the UK, I bring an international perspective to my work. Currently, I’m the Environmental Economics Graduate Research Fellow at the Water Center at UPenn, where I combine my passion for data analysis with a focus on ESG metrics and ROI analysis in infrastructure projects.
