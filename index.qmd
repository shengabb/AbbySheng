      I am a dedicated first-year Master of Environmental Studies student at UPenn with a passion for integrating economic principles into environmental solutions. Joining the Water Center team as an Environmental Economist, I am excited to contribute to the centre’s research and initiatives focused on environmental and economic analysis. With a strong background in economics from LSE and international experience from both Beijing and London, I bring valuable insights into economic modelling and analysis. Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking and loves nature.
